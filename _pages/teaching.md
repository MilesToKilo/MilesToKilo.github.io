I am a teacher-scholar who sees the value of integrating teaching and research to better train students and impart lifelong lessons. My pedagogical training began when I was tutoring English and writing in community college, and I have practiced different active learning approaches since I started teaching in my master’s program. In my experience, incorporating a research framework into class discussions or course materials has proved effective for teaching students how to think critically like a scientist. This is arguably a more important life lesson compared to the evolutionary events of chordates (both are good lessons regardless!).

My teaching philosophy is based on allowing students to develop a growth mindset where they can focus on improving rather than reaching fixed milestones. Students are often fixated on memorizing concepts and earning the highest grade possible; however, my goal is for them to learn transferable skills like critical thinking, which is not easily taught in a book. The most important approach I use in my labs is building an inclusive classroom culture for the students. Building this classroom culture is foundational for my students because it allows them to try new things in uncomfortable conditions and fosters a like-minded community helping each other learn.
