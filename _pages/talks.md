## Outreach  
I believe that academics play a critical role in nurturing the next generation. This obviously involves our interactions with students in the classroom, but our influence encompasses all the spaces that we occupy whether by choice or necessity. I have pursued additional roles within my community to purposefully increase my visibility and reach to help students in need. Personally, I feel a strong desire to help first-generation college students because, in my experience, I did not know how to navigate academia.  

Currently, I am entering my second year as the Professional Development Chair for the [Society for the Advancement of Chicanos/Hispanics and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS)](https://www.sacnas.org/). My main goal is to build connections with other campus organizations so that more students are aware of available resources and opportunities whether hosted by SACNAS or not. I am building these connections through joint events targeting the needs of our respective campus organizations.  
### Joint Events  
[UROP Research Discovery Program](https://urop.uci.edu/research-discovery-program/) Panel on Student Organizations  
UROP [SURP](https://urop.uci.edu/urop-opportunities/#surp) Proposal Workshop  
UROP Getting Involved with Research Workshop  
Pro-Health Journal Club Applying for Graduate School Workshop  

## Mentoring Experiences  
**UC Irvine – _Science Writing Integrated Mentoring (SWIM) Program_**  
I guided 5 students from generating research ideas to finalizing their individual research proposals.  
**CSU San Bernardino – _Coyote Research Ambassador_**  
I performed an array of tasks including: peer mentoring undergraduates with their research goals, hosted virtual workshops on research topics, hosted faculty interviews on Instagram to increase outreach to the student population, and more.  
**Association of Filipino Scientists in America (AFSA) – _Mentoring Program_**  
I shared insight about my Filipino experience in academia and demystified application requirements for fellowships and graduate school. I spent 2 years as a participant, and 2 years as a coordinator for the program.  
## Research Projects  
### Interactive effects of aging and genipin on tendon materials properties  
Genipin is a relatively novel exogenous crosslinking compound that increases the mechanical properties of collagenous structures like tendons. Multiple studies have researched genipin’s effects on tendons ex vivo; however, they have only studied subjects at advanced ages. This project is investigating the application of genipin at multiple life stages to analyze how age might mitigate or enhance the effects of genipin.  
**Students involved:**  
Hanna Chow – Received [SURP Award](https://urop.uci.edu/urop-opportunities/#surp).  
Kelli Chung – Received [SURP Award](https://urop.uci.edu/urop-opportunities/#surp).  
### Comparing tail tendon materials properties between kangaroo rat and lab rats  
Kangaroo rats (k-rats) have a [rapid escape response](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hyKWwiefF8) that hurls themselves into the air, and they use their long tails to reposition their bodies and land feet first. We’re interested in how this behavior may elicit changes in the tail tendon properties, so we’re comparing k-rats to the closely related lab rats.  
**Students involved:**  
Emily Yamauchi – Received [SURP Award](https://urop.uci.edu/urop-opportunities/#surp), [Travel Award](https://urop.uci.edu/urop-opportunities/#travel), [Research Experience Fellowship](https://urop.uci.edu/urop-opportunities/#ref), and [SICB Broadening Participation Travel Award](https://sicb.org/broadening-participation-professional-development-award-application/). Presented at [SICB 2023](https://academic.oup.com/icb/article/63/Supplement_1/S1/7078743).  
Viktor Gevirtzman – Received [SURP Award](https://urop.uci.edu/urop-opportunities/#surp).  
Denise Moreno – Presented 2024 [UCI Undergraduate Research Symposium](https://urop.uci.edu/symposium/).

### Effects of maturation and exercise on tendon materials properties  
My master’s project focused on the effects of maturation and exercise on mice tendon materials properties. We utilized a mice colony known as [High-Runners (HR)](https://sites.google.com/ucr.edu/hrmice/home) that are artificially selected for high voluntary wheel running. My project incorporated activity levels (HR vs. Control), age (Young vs. Adult), and exercise type (Wheel vs. Jump vs. Control) to investigate the interactive effects on tendon morphology and mechanical properties.  
**Students involved:**  
Apolo Ibáñez – Awarded [OSR summer funding](https://www.csusb.edu/student-research/faculty/osr-undergraduate-summer-research-program). Apolo continued as a post-baccalaureate researcher with [Dr. Natalie Holt](https://theholtlab.weebly.com/) at UC Riverside, then started his master’s program at CSU San Bernardino with [Dr. Angela Horner](https://hornerlabcsusb.org/).  
Gabby Morgan – Awarded [OSR summer funding](https://www.csusb.edu/student-research/faculty/osr-undergraduate-summer-research-program).  
Haleigh Hernandez – Presented at CSUSB’s [Meeting of the Minds Symposium](https://www.csusb.edu/student-research/events-and-calendar/meeting-minds).

### Association of Filipino Scientists in America (AFSA)  
Moarley Palpal-latoc – I connected with Moarley through the mentoring program offered by the Association of Filipino Scientists in America. We shared our experiences with navigating academia as Filipino scientists, and I provided insight and advice about Moarley’s undergraduate plans. He graduated from UC Berkeley with his BS in Psychology.
