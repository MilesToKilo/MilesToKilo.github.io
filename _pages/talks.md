## Outreach Events
**CSU San Bernardino - Panel Discussion on _Students Accepted into Graduate Programs_**
We discussed the difficulties of applying to graduate programs, and I shared the lessons learned throughout my master’s program and going into my PhD program.
**CSU Long Beach – _National Biomechanics Day_**  
Our lab coordinated with the movement science and robotics labs to introduce students to biomechanics. We facilitated a biomechanics activity on lever systems using vertebrate skeletons to introduce students to comparative biomechanics.
**CSU Long Beach – _Jordan High School visit_**  
We presented ongoing research projects in Dr. Sandy Kawano’s lab to high school seniors, and informed them about applications of biomechanics research to the medical field.
## Mentoring Experiences  
**UC Irvine – _Science Writing Integrated Mentoring (SWIM) Program_**  
I guided 5 students from generating research ideas to finalizing their individual research proposals.  
**CSU San Bernardino – _Coyote Research Ambassador_**  
I performed an array of tasks including: peer mentoring undergraduates with their research goals, hosted virtual workshops on research topics, hosted faculty interviews on Instagram to increase outreach to the student population, and more.  
**Association of Filipino Scientists in America (AFSA) – _Mentoring Program_**  
I shared insight about my Filipino experience in academia and demystified application requirements for fellowships and graduate school. I spent 2 years as a participant, and 2 years as a coordinator for the program.  
## Undergraduate Mentees  
**Emily Yamauchi**  
Emily is a senior at UCI comparing the materials properties of tail tendon fascicles between kangaroo rat and lab rats. She recently received research funding through the Summer Undergraduate Research Program!  
**Viktor Gevirtzman**  
Viktor is a junior at UCI comparing the materials properties of tail tendon fascicles between kangaroo rat and lab rats. He recently received research funding through the Summer Undergraduate Research Program!  
**Apolo Ibáñez**  
Apolo assisted with my master’s tendon research at CSU San Bernardino. I guided him through tendon dissections and image processing via ImageJ among other responsibilities. Apolo graduated from CSUSB in 2022 with his BS in Biology and worked as a post-baccalaureate researcher with [Dr. Natalie Holt]( https://theholtlab.weebly.com/) at UC Riverside. Apolo will be starting his master’s program in Fall 2023 at CSU San Bernardino with [Dr. Angela Horner](https://hornerlabcsusb.org/).  
**Gabby Morgan**  
Gabby assisted with my master’s tendon research at CSU San Bernardino. I guided her through tendon dissections and video recording of materials tests via ProCapture. Gabby graduated from CSUSB in 2022 with her BS in Biology.  
**Haleigh Hernandez**  
Haleigh assisted with my master’s tendon research at CSU San Bernardino. I guided her through tendon dissections and video analysis via ProAnalyst, and she presented her work at CSUSB’s Meeting of the Minds Symposium. Haleigh graduated from CSUSB in 2022 with her BS in Biology.  
**Brooke Baker**  
Brooke assisted with my master’s tendon research at CSU San Bernardino. She assisted with animal care, and I taught her how to track and organize data collected regarding mouse weight and food consumption. Booke graduated from CSUSB in 2022 with her BS in Biology.  
**Moarley Palpal-latoc**  
I connected with Moarley through the mentoring program offered by the Association of Filipino Scientists in America. We shared our experiences with navigating academia as Filipino scientists, and I provided insight and advice about Moarley’s undergraduate plans. He is currently attending UC Berkeley for his BS in Psychology.
