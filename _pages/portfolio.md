## Biomechanics Research  
I am broadly interested in studying the relationship between form and function in musculoskeletal systems, and how these relationships change in different environments. My undergraduate research explored the differences in salamander forelimb kinematics by comparing how semi-aquatic and predominantly terrestrial salamanders overcome a similar challenge: terrestrial locomotion. During my masterâ€™s research, I investigated the effects of maturation and exercise on mice tendon mechanics, and I plan to further explore tendon remodeling with my PhD research. Currently, I am comparing the materials properties of rat tendon fascicles from the core and peripheral regions and am proposing to include the entire muscle-tendon unit for future projects.  

## Education Research  
I am passionate about continually improving my teaching, and I am currently exploring higher education research as an avenue for improvement. I often rely on studies that systematically analyze pedagogical approaches to incorporate evidence-based practices (i.e., active learning, flipped-class structures, etc); however, some approaches have not been specifically addressed in Anatomy and Physiology classes, which I plan to teach in the future. I am currently collaborating with faculty at CSU San Bernardino to investigate the impacts of varying prerequisites on student success in Anatomy and Physiology courses.
