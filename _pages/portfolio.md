## Biomechanics Research  
I am broadly interested in studying the relationship between form and function in musculoskeletal systems, and how these relationships change under various conditions such as aging, disease, and environmental conditions. I am currently interested in utilizing genipin to experimentally alter tendon materials properties and systematically characterize the performance of in-series muscles. This research is extended by studying the influence of genipin on tail tendon fascicles at multiple life stages. 

My undergraduate research explored the differences in salamander forelimb kinematics by comparing how semi-aquatic and predominantly terrestrial salamanders overcome a similar challenge: terrestrial locomotion. During my masterâ€™s research, I investigated the effects of maturation and exercise on mice tendon mechanics, and I plan to further explore tendon remodeling with my PhD research.
