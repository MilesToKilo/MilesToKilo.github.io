My [GitHub](https://github.com/MilesToKilo) documents my coding journey thus far. I make repositories for all of my coding projects, and I make them public when I feel like they are in an acceptable state; code can always be more efficient, but the point is to share what I have figured out how to do. Hopefully my shared code helps whoever cares to read it!  
### Data Visualization
I started learning R by mainly reading [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) among other R tutorials. I thought a time worthy project would be to learn how to code an assortment of graphs that I could use to make graphs in the future. I made a repository of [Graph Templates](https://github.com/MilesToKilo/Graph-Templates) that I actually use to refresh my memory when I begin data analysis. I will admit that these templates are not at all efficient, but I learned how to make the tiniest of edits. Rest assured, I know the more efficient coding options; I just don’t plan on updating my repository.  
### Biostatistics
During my master’s program, I took a biostatistics class with [Dr. Dave Smith](http://davesolancesmith.com/) at CSU San Bernardino. I learned a great deal of statistics and how to code these tests using Base R. With the approval of Dr. Smith, I converted his lessons to use functions from the “tidyverse” package, utilized datasets provided by R, and included documentation that explained the code as well as the stats. I have an assortment of statistical tests listed in my [Biostatistics](https://github.com/MilesToKilo/BioStatistics) repository if you would like to check that out, but please remember that I am not a stats expert, and I am still continuously honing my stats skills!  
### Wheel Running Tracker
For a part of my master’s research, I had to record wheel running activity for 40 mice over 12 or 18 weeks. I learned how to import batches of data, wrangle the data into a workable format, and complete data analysis to identify different measures of wheel behavior. Although my code is not in an acceptable state for a public repository, I plan on returning to this project in the near future to fix it up for sharing.
