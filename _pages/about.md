PhD in Biology, UC Irvine (Planned for 2027)  
MS in Biology, CSU San Bernardino (2022)  
BS in Biology Education, CSU Long Beach (2018)  
AAs in Natural Sciences, and Social & Behavioral Sciences, East Los Angeles College (2015)  

I am a first generation Mexican-Filipino college student who grew up in East LA, and I have luckily stayed near my family in the SoCal region for my entire academic career. I aspire to share my passion for biomechanics with students at a 4-year university, but really, my main passion is helping students become better versions of themselves.  
I began my research career with [Dr. Sandy Kawano](https://sandykawano.weebly.com/) at CSU Long Beach (now at George Washington University) who introduced me to a side of academia that I wasn’t even aware of! I pursued biomechanics and education research as an undergraduate and post-baccalaureate researcher in her lab, and overall, I developed a strong foundation for research under her supervision. I continued my academic journey at CSU San Bernardino in [Dr. Angela Horner’s](https://hornerlabcsusb.org/) lab investigating the effects of maturation and exercise on mice tendon mechanics. This is where I really grew as a researcher because I had the freedom to pursue my envisioned research without the fear of mistakes. Numerous mistakes were made, but Dr. Horner helped mitigate the consequences and kept me on my path to success.  

Now, I am in [Dr. Manny Azizi’s](https://azizi.bio.uci.edu/) lab furthering my biomechanics research focusing on dynamics of the entire muscle-tendon unit. My proposed research connects my training in tendon mechanics at CSUSB to the muscle physiology focus of Dr. Azizi’s lab, and I’m excited to see how my research unfolds!
