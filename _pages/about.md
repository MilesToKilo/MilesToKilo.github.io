I am a first generation Mexican-Filipino college student who grew up in East LA, and I have luckily stayed near my family in the SoCal region for my entire academic career. I aspire to share my passion for biomechanics with students at a 4-year university, but really, my main passion is helping students become better versions of themselves.
